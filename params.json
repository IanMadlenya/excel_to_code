{"google":"","body":"# Excel To Code\r\n\r\nConverts some excel spreadsheets (.xlsx, not .xls) into C. This allows the excel spreadsheets to be run programatically, without excel, anywhere that compiles basic dependency free C code. This can be handy to allow excel to be used as the calculating engine behind websites (e.g., The [DECC 2050 Pathways Calculator](http://2050-calculator-tool.decc.gsi.gov.uk) is powered by this 50+ page [excel model](http://www.decc.gov.uk/assets/decc/11/tackling-climate-change/2050/3696-2050-calculator-with-costs.XLSX)).\r\n\r\n## Prepare\r\n\r\nMake sure you have ruby 1.9.2 or later installed, a copy of git, and a basic C compiler\r\n\r\n## Install\r\n```sh\r\ngem install bundler # May need to use sudo\r\ngit clone https://github.com/tamc/excel_to_code.git\r\ncd excel_to_code\r\nbundle\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Run\r\n\r\nCan be run as a command line:\r\n\r\n    ./bin/excel_to_c <excel_file_name>\r\n\r\n… with several options:\t\r\n\r\n\t./bin/excel_to_c --compile --run-tests --settable <name of input worksheet> --prune-except <name of output worksheet> <excel file name> \r\n\r\n… or as a ruby library, see the [examples](https://github.com/tamc/excel_to_code/tree/master/examples) directory for ideas.\r\n\r\n## Know the limits\r\n\r\n1. Not tested at all on Windows\r\n2. INDIRECT formula must be convertable at runtime into a standard formula\r\n3. Doesn't implement all functions (just the handful of functions with an R or C after their name in [this list](https://github.com/tamc/excel_to_code/blob/master/doc/Which_functions_are_implemented.md) )\r\n4. Doesn't implement references that involve range unions and lists\r\n5. Sometimes gives cells as being empty, when excel would give the cell as having a numeric value of zero\r\n","tagline":"Excel spreadsheets, compiled to run-anywhere C","note":"Don't delete this file!
